abstract: "TEST TEST TESTMany economic studies use shift-share instruments to estimate causal
  effects. Often, all shares need to fulfill an exclusion restriction, making
  the identifying assumption strict. This paper proposes to use methods that
  relax the exclusion restriction by selecting invalid shares. I apply the
  methods in simulations and two empirical examples: the effect of immigration
  on wages and of Chinese import exposure on employment. In the first
  application, the coefficient becomes lower and often changes sign, but this is
  reconcilable with arguments made in the literature. In the second application,
  the findings are mostly robust to the use of the new methods."
