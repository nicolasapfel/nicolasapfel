abstract: We propose a procedure, which combines hierarchical clustering with a
  test of overidentifying restrictions for selecting valid instrumental
  variables (IV) from a large set of IVs. Some of these may be invalid in that
  they fail the exclusion restriction. We show that if the largest group of IVs
  is valid, our method achieves oracle properties. Unlike existing techniques,
  our method addresses weak instruments, multiple endogenous regressors and
  heterogeneous treatment effects. In simulations our procedure outperforms the
  Hard Thresholding and the Confidence Interval method. The method is applied to
  estimating the effect of immigration on wages and the return to education.
